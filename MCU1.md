# **Mastering Microcontroller and Embedded Driver Development**

About the Work

---
    This work is about learning the concepts of various hardware components working principles, architecture and programming of various Microcontrollers for utilizing on my needs.

    so the concepts and architecture I will be learning are
        - Embedded Code Debugging
        - Understanding MCU Memory Map
        - MCU Bus Interface
        - Understanding MCU Clocks and Details
        - Understanding MCU Clock tree
        - Understanding MCU Vector table
        - Understanding MCU interrupt Design, NVIC, Interrupt handling
        - Importance of "Volatile" Keyword
        - GPIO concepts
        - GPIO Programming structure and Registers
        - GPIO Registers : SPEED, PULLUP/DOWN, IDR and ODR
        - GPIO Alternate functionality register and usage
        - GPIO peripheral clock control
        - GPIO driver development and MCU specific header file with bus domain and peripheral Details
        - Structuring peripheral registers
        - Writing Clock enable and disable macros
        - GPIO driver API requirements and handle structure
        - GPIO driver API Implementation : Clock control, GPIO init and de-init, GPIO data read and write
        - GPIO pin Interrupt configuration
